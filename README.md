# 2017 Sketches

These are sketches in two sense.
First, I've been messing around with Processing and p5.js, and a program is often referred to as a sketch. Expect a lot of p5.js sketches.
Second, and related to the first, is that this is really just a public collection of the little code doodles I do at night, after my kid is sleeping, while my wife and I are sitting watching television. My only criteria here is that I get something on the screen, not writing bullet proof (or even pretty) code.


I'm hoping to check _something_ in every day for 2017.
